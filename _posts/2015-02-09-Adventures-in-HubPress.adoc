==== Things just got a little easier...

*A little while back* Github introduced {url-ghpages}[Github Pages], where you could easily use your free Github account to host HTML pages. Well today I discovered {url-hubpress}[Hubpress] which takes that concept a step further and gives you a free blogging system that just uses your free Github hosting.

*Now there are* defintely other tools out there that let you do something similar, Jeckyl comes to mind. But Hubpress makes it really easy with a nice clean editor and a live preview window. Once you are done with your post, click _Publish_ and you are good to go!

*The biggest caveat* to all this by far, is the writing actual HTML part. People everywhere are trying to solve the issue of having to write real HTML code in a web-based editor, and make it easier for those not that familiar. Markdown is one shortcut language, AsciiDocs is another, and is the flavor of choice by HupPress.
